**Cover Letter Template: Casual Style for B2B Sales**  

**Dear {{hiring_manager}},**  

I hope this message finds you well! I’m reaching out because I’m genuinely excited about the {{position}} role at {{company}}. With my background in {{experience}} and a passion for building meaningful business relationships, I’m confident I’d be a great fit for your team.  

What draws me to {{company}} is your reputation for {{specific_company_value_or_achievement}}. In my previous role, I successfully {{specific_achievement_related_to_sales}}, which I believe aligns perfectly with the goals of this position. My skills in {{skills}} have consistently helped me exceed targets and deliver value to clients.  

One thing I love about B2B sales is the opportunity to solve real problems for businesses. For example, {{brief_story_or_example_of_sales_success}} shows how I’ve used my ability to {{specific_skill}} to drive results. I’d be thrilled to bring that same energy and expertise to {{company}}.  

I’d love the chance to chat more about how I can contribute to your team. Thanks so much for considering my application—I’m really looking forward to the possibility of working with you all!  

Best regards,
